        </div>
        <p>During my second semester at GIMM we had to do an animation that told a story. Me and my group mates decided
          to do an animation about how scary it is to grow up. I did the character design, found the royalty free music
          we used, and animated from 0:00 to 0:23. A lot of the animation I did involved tweening. We used Adobe Animate
          but I also tried out some of my animation in Open Toonz as well. It was pretty fun, although I wish I could
          have alloted more time towards the project.</p>

        <p>Light City Chronicles in an interactive comic that me and a group of other GIMM students made. While I did
          not come up with the intial idea for the comic I did a majority of the writing for it. I also did the
          character design for UV girl, Microwaves, Gamma Rays, and Xray. I designed the cover page, did most of the
          dialog and wrote the final page of the comic. Additionally I made a radio tuning mini game so you can see
          whatever text Radiowaves was saying in the comic. I would have definetly spent more time on this mini game if
          I had not gotten so focused on project management and art, but I feel like all of my efforts were very
          important to the success of this project.</p>

        <p>Green Thumb was a game that me and a few other people made in a week for a Game Jam. It's a precision
          platformer with a focus on growth. When the main character dies they grow a platform that the player can jump
          on in their next life. The goal is to make it to the end of the level by dying the least amount of times. I
          worked mostly on the map artwork. Tilemaps, enemy designs and other things you could jump on were my biggest
          focus. I learned a lot about making tilemaps for this project and I would really love to be able to create
          more tilemaps for games in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Mine Escape was a game that I made in my first semester at GIMM. I did not make any of the art assets for
          this project and instead focused on making the code. It was my first time coding ever, and you can see from
          the gameplay that it is a little clunky, but for my first time i'm pretty impressed that I got as far as I
          did. I think about returning to this project sometimes and remaking it or improving the code and adding in my
          own art.</p>
